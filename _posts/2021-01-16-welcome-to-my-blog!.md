> <i>Verba Volant, Scripta Manent!</i> - <strong>Latin Proverb</strong> <br> Spoken words fly away, written words remain.

Hey, it's Recep! You can learn more about me here in the ["About"](/about/) page!  

I took the below three philosophies very seriously as I started my blog:

- <strong>Verba Volant, Scripta Manent</strong> - Spoken words fly away, written words remain. I've always loved taking notes of the things I learned and writing documents for the things I've built because that's what keeps the information accessible at any time. Although I digitalize most of my notes, pens and notebooks are still my favorites. :)

- <strong>Teaching is the best teacher</strong> - To teach something to someone, you have to get into the subject in detail. Studying some topics is good but teaching them to others is a whole another thing. It helps with two things, you understand the topic better and enhance your communication skills.

- <strong>Ideas worth spreading</strong> - I love sharing what I know with others via any medium, but writing has always been my first choice. The essential purpose of this blog is to make my knowledge easily accessible to anybody. 

I hope you enjoy reading as much as I enjoy writing my blog.
